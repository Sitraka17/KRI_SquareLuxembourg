    Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) are essential components of any risk management system. 
    When displayed on the home page of a dashboard overviewing risk, KRIs provide a quick snapshot of the most critical risks facing an organization. 
    
    KRIs are used to track and monitor the status of risk management activities and alert stakeholders to emerging risks. By selecting the right KRIs for display on the home page of a dashboard, organizations can effectively communicate risk information to stakeholders, improve risk awareness, and promote informed decision-making.

    The data for this cross-chain comparison were selected from the [**Flipside Crypto**](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz)
    data platform by using its **REST API**. These queries are currently set to **re-run every 24 hours** to cover the latest
    data and are imported as a JSON file directly to each page. The data were selected with a **1 day delay** for all
    blockchains to be in sync with one another. The codes for this tool are saved and accessible in its 
    [**GitHub Repository**](https://sitraka17.github.io/).

    It is worth mentioning that this tool is just a POC for KRI. Square Management Luxembourg propose you a better tool.
